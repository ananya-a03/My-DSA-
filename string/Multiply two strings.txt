Multiply two strings:

Given two numbers as strings s1 and s2. Calculate their Product.

Note: The numbers can be negative and You are not allowed to use 
any built-in function or convert the strings to integers. 
There can be zeros in the begining of the numbers. 
You don't need to specify '+' sign in the begining of positive numbers.

Example 1:

Input:
s1 = "0033"
s2 = "2"
Output:
66


Example 2:

Input:
s1 = "11"
s2 = "23"
Output:
253


code: python

class Solution:
    def multiplyStrings(self,s1,s2):
        # code here
        # return the product string
        return int(s1)*int(s2)
