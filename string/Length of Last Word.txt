Example 3:

Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"

CODE:

class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLastWord(string s) {
        int ans = 0;
        int right=s.size()-1;
        while(right>=0){
            if(s[right]!=' '){
                ans++;
            }
            else{
                if(ans>0){
                    return ans;
                }
            }
            right--;
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
